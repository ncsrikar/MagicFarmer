# MagicFarmer
This is a marketplace for farmers and vendors where farmers can interact 
with the marketplace by merely texting.

## Problems we are trying to solve

MagicFarmer aims to get farmers a fair and a profitable price
for their produce. 

Farmers often have to sell at a lower price owing to improper storage facilities.
We hope to solve this by connecting vendors to farmers pre-harvest season. Our marketplace aims to cut unnecessary middlemen and improve interaction with the agricultural sector.


## How does it work?

The farmers and vendors update all their necessary details(documents) on to the MagicFarmer website.
Farmers can do this by messaging the marketplace their document numbers. 
Vendors however will have to use our smartphone app or our website to upload their details.
These details are updated on our Firebase database in real-time.

Once the users have registered and have been verified, the farmers post the expected amount of produce and the price they expect to sell it at via the SMS facility or by directly interacting via the website.
Whereas the vendors will be allowed to place bids.
Our algorithm in the background will show us where to source the produce from for a particular vendor such that the logistics are economically feasible and at the same time meet the vendor's requirements.
